ANNOUNCING Bitmask, the internet encryption toolkit, release 0.3.5

The LEAP  team is  pleased to announce  the immediate  availability of
version 0.3.5  of Bitmask,  the Internet Encryption  Toolkit, codename
"I can stand on one foot".

https://downloads.leap.se/client/

LEAP  (LEAP  Encryption Access  Project)  develops  a plan  to  secure
everyday communication, breaking down into discrete services.

Bitmask is  the desktop client to  connect to the services  offered by
the LEAP  Platform.  In the  current phase the supported  services are
Encrypted Internet Proxy and Encrypted Mail.

The   Encrypted  Internet   Proxy  provides   circumvention,  location
anonymization, and traffic encryption  in a hassle-free, automatically
self-configuring fashion.

Encrypted  Mail offers  automatic encryption  and decryption  for both
outgoing and  incoming email, adding  public key cryptography  to your
mail  without you  ever  having  to worry  about  key distribution  or
signature verification.

You can read about this and many  other cool things in the user manual
and the developer notes, which can be found online at:

WARNING: This is still  part of a beta release of  our software, a lot
of testing and auditing is still needed, so indeed use it, and feed us
back, fork it  and contribute to its development, but  by any means DO
NOT trust your life to it (yet!).

WHAT CAN THIS VERSION OF BITMASK DO FOR ME?

Bitmask 0.3.5 is a bugfix release  but it also has improvements to the
UI design,  it's still a work  in progress since it  will change after
testing in this release, but  it's progressing nicely.  We have again,
better mail  support, with detached  signatures and compliance  with a
couple of RFC. You can refer to the CHANGELOG for the meat.

We also  re-added support for  Windows, although  it might be  a bumpy
ride until we smooth the corners a little bit more.

As always,  you can  connect to the  Encrypted Internet  Proxy service
offered by a  provider of your choice, and enjoy  a encrypted internet
connection that the spying eyes can only track back to your provider.

The Encrypted Mail services will run local SMTP and IMAP proxies that,
once you configure the mail  client of your choice, will automatically
encrypt and decrypt your email using GPG encryption under the hood.

If it  is the first  time you run Bitmask,  the first run  wizard will
help you registering an user  with your selected provider, downloading
all the config files needed to connect to the various LEAP services.

LICENSE

You may  use Bitmask under the  GNU General Public License,  version 3
or, at your option, any later  version. See the file "LICENSE" for the
terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3.

In  addition,  as a  special  exception,  the copyright  holders  give

OpenSSL  library  under  certain   conditions  as  described  in  each
individual source  file, and distribute linked  combinations including
the two.

INSTALLATION

We distribute the current version of Bitmask as standalone bundles for
GNU/Linux and OSX, but it is likely  that you are able to run it under
other systems,  specially if you are  skillful and patience is  one of
your virtues.

Have a look at "docs/user/install.rst".

Packages will be soon provided for  debian and ubuntu, and the release
of windows bundles will be resumed shortly.

We will  love to hear  if you are  interested in help  making packages
available for any other system.

BUGS

You can send the bugs our way  by pointing your telnet session to port
443 on https://leap.se/code.  We will do  our best to make them follow
our intensive bug-reeducation program.

HACKING

You can find us in the #leap-dev channel on the freenode network.

If you are lucky enough, you can also spot us drinking mate, sleepless
in night  trains, rooftops,  rainforests, lonely islands  and, always,
beyond any border.
